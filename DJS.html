										<h3>Experience</h3>
										<p>As a member of the coding department on a Mars rover team, my role involved managing members and 
											working with data collection, labelling, and training object detection models like YOLOv4 and EfficientDet. 
											One of the core aspects of my role was conducting experiments to optimize and improve the performance of 
											these object detection models. 
											This involved fine-tuning the model parameters, implementing novel techniques, and analyzing the 
											results to enhance their accuracy and efficiency. By constantly iterating and refining our models, 
											we were able to make significant advancements in the rover's ability to detect and recognize various 
											objects on the Martian surface.
											<p>Through this experience, I gained profound insights into the world of object detection algorithms and their practical applications. 
												I honed my skills in fine-tuning models, understanding architectural intricacies, and optimizing their performance.
												 It instilled in me a deep appreciation for the potential of computer vision in driving groundbreaking advancements 
												 in exploration and discovery.
												Additionally, we simulated and analysed the map provided by organizers using the Gazebo simulator to be mentally prepared during the competition. 
											It was a rewarding experience contributing to great achievements and collaborating with a talented team.</p>
										
											<h3>Europen Rover Challenge</h3>
										<p>European Rover Challenge (ERC) is one of the best and prestigious Robotics competitions worldwide. 
											It is the annual international Martian Rover competition attended by teams from around the world. 
											The competition has been organized since 2014 in Poland and is held in the 2nd week of September annually. 
											ERC 2020 was conducted from 11th – 13th September 2020. ERC 2020 was made virtual due to the COVID-19 pandemic 
											and the events were conducted remotely.</p>
										<ul>
											<li>We secured Overall 3rd Position globally..</li>
											<li>Won the Best Science Planning award among all teams in ERC 2020</li>
											<li>First ever Asian and Indian team to have made it in the Top 3 teams in the history of European Rover Challenge (ERC 2020).</li>
											<li>Also, it was the first time a team from our college had achieved a podium finish in their debut year 
												in an international competition.</li>
